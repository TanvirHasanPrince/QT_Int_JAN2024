## Welcome!

Welcome! This project is a webpage built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and React Modal. The goal was to create a visually appealing webpage based on a provided design, fetch data from a specified API, and implement a form for adding items.

## Task Overview

### UI Design

I have created the design, gave close attention to colors, fonts, and overall layout. The webpage includes a button that opens a modal for adding new cards, which will not POST the data to the server but will so the data in the cards.

I have implemented a form on the webpage that allows users to add items to the list. Frontend validation is in place to catch any input mistakes.
